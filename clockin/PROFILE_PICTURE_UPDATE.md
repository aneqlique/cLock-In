# Profile Picture Integration for Posts

## Summary
Updated backend and frontend to include unique profile pictures for each post and comment in the diary/timeline screen.

## Backend Changes

### 1. Post Model (`backend/models/Post.js`)
- **Added `profilePicture` field to `postSchema`**
  - Type: String
  - Default: '' (empty string)
  - Stores the URL of the user's profile picture

- **Added `profilePicture` field to `commentSchema`**
  - Type: String
  - Default: '' (empty string)
  - Stores the URL of the commenter's profile picture

### 2. Post Controller (`backend/controllers/postController.js`)

#### getPosts()
- Updated to populate `profilePicture` from User model
- Changed: `.populate('userId', 'username')` → `.populate('userId', 'username profilePicture')`

#### createOrUpdatePost()
- **Creating new posts**: Now includes `profilePicture: user.profilePicture || ''`
- **Updating posts**: Now updates `post.profilePicture = user.profilePicture || ''`
- Ensures profile picture is always synced with user's current profile picture

#### addComment()
- Now includes `profilePicture: user.profilePicture || ''` when adding comments
- Each comment stores the profile picture of the user who made it

## Frontend Changes

### 3. Diary Screen (`mobile/lib/presentation/screens/diary/diarytl_screen.dart`)

#### State Variables
- **Removed**: `_profilePicture` (no longer needed)
- Each post now carries its own profile picture data

#### Post Display
- **Extracts `postProfilePicture`** from post data
- Shows profile picture from `post['profilePicture']`
- Falls back to username initials if no profile picture exists

#### Comment Display
- **Extracts `commentProfilePicture`** from comment data
- Shows profile picture from `comment['profilePicture']`
- Falls back to username initials if no profile picture exists

## How It Works

### Posts
1. When a task is set to public, the post is created with the user's current profile picture
2. The `profilePicture` URL is stored directly in the post document
3. When fetching posts, each post displays its own stored profile picture
4. If user updates their profile picture after posting, old posts retain their original picture

### Comments
1. When a user adds a comment, their current profile picture is stored with the comment
2. Each comment shows the profile picture of the user who made it
3. Comments maintain their original profile pictures even if the user changes theirs later

## Security & Token Handling
- ✅ No changes to authentication middleware
- ✅ Token handling remains unchanged
- ✅ User authorization checks are preserved
- ✅ All existing security measures intact

## Benefits
1. **Unique Identities**: Each post shows the correct user's profile picture
2. **Visual Consistency**: Users can easily identify who posted what
3. **Comment Authors**: Clear visual identification of comment authors
4. **Historical Accuracy**: Profile pictures are preserved as they were when posted/commented
5. **Better UX**: More engaging and personalized timeline experience

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] Verify posts show correct profile pictures for different users
- [ ] Verify comments show correct profile pictures
- [ ] Verify fallback to initials works when no profile picture exists
- [ ] Verify token authentication still works
- [ ] Verify existing posts without profile pictures display correctly (should show initials)
- [ ] Verify new posts capture profile pictures correctly
- [ ] Verify profile picture updates in settings reflect in new posts

## Migration Notes
- Existing posts in database will have empty `profilePicture` fields (default: '')
- These will automatically show username initials until the post is updated
- No database migration required - the default value handles backwards compatibility
